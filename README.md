# Hospital Management System Repo Pattern CSharp

The Hospital Management System is a console-based application built in C# following the repository pattern for managing patient records in a hospital. It provides functionalities to list patients, add new patients, update patient information, and delete patients from the system.

## Features

- **List Patients:** View a list of all patients currently registered in the system.
- **Add Patient:** Add a new patient to the system by providing their ID, full name, and location.
- **Update Patient:** Update the information of an existing patient, including their full name and location.
- **Delete Patient:** Remove a patient from the system based on their ID.
- **Search Patient:** Search for a specific patient by their ID and display their details.

## Project Structure

The project follows the repository pattern, separating concerns between data access and business logic. It consists of two main folders:

- **DataAccessLayer:** Contains the data access classes responsible for interacting with the patient data.
- **BusinessLayer:** Contains the business logic classes responsible for implementing the application's functionality.

## File Details

- **Program.cs:** Contains the main entry point of the application and the user interface for interacting with the system.
- **Patient.cs:** Defines the `Patient` class representing a patient entity with properties such as ID, full name, and location.
- **IPatientDataAccess.cs:** Defines the interface for the patient data access layer.
- **PatientDataAccess.cs:** Implements the patient data access layer using a hardcoded list of patients.
- **PatientManagement.cs:** Implements the business logic layer for managing patients.

## Usage
